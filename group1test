First: Create a powershell script which gets 3 integer numbers as parameters (in the case of
missing parameters, read the numbers from the keyboard) and gives back the sum of the
first two and subtract the third!

if($args.Length -ne 3){
    $a=@(0..2)
    Write-Output "need parameters"
    for($i=0;$i -lt 3; $i++){
       $a[$i]=Read-Host
    }
    $result = [Int]$a[0] + [Int]$a[1] - [Int]$a[2]
    Write-Host $result
}
else{
    $result=$args[0]+$args[1]-$args[2]
    Write-Host $result
}

2nd: Create a powershell script which gets a lot of numbers as parameters and writes them out
in reverse order! (Previously, we do not know how many parameters we shall have.)
.\second.ps1 1 2 3 4 5 =&gt; 5 4 3 2 1

$tmp=Read-Host
$num=@()
$cnt=0
foreach($i in $tmp.Split(" "))
{
   $num = $num + $i
   $cnt++
    
}

for ($j=$cnt;$j -ge 0 ;$j--)
{

     echo $num[$j]


}

3rd : Create a powershell script which gets a filename as a parameter. In the file there are
sentences in each line. Give back the shortest line!



4th: Create a Powershell script, which gets a file name and a number (N) as an argument and
writes out the first and last N lines of the file! Check the existence of the file!
